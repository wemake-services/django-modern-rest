Testimonials
==============

We're grateful for the feedback from our community! Here are some testimonials
from developers about Modern REST:

   | The one thing I really love about **django-modern-rest** is its pluggable
   | serializers and validators. Frameworks that are tightly coupled
   | with **pydantic** can be really painful to work with.
